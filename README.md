Run `python test.py` to execute the program.

### Time & Space complexities
The run time of the program is based on a single while loop over a fixed list of operators and the `x in s` operation. For the while loop its O(1) as it loops over a fixed list, for the `x in s` its O(n).
*Time Complexity* : **O(n)**.

The input string is split into an array of elements that consists of operators and operands. So the *total space complexity* is also: **O(n)**.
